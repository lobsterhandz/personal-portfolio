            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Hey there! I'm Jose, an aspiring <strong>full-stack developer</strong>, <strong>tech enthusiast</strong>, and someone who loves to think outside the box. I enjoy the process of building things, whether it's web applications, AI models, or physical gadgets—my passion for technology has no limits.</p>
                <p>I've always been curious about how things work. From <strong>modding electronics</strong> to experimenting with <strong>machine learning models</strong>, I'm constantly driven by the desire to learn and create. If there's a challenge, chances are I'll find it fascinating.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm learning to master <strong>full-stack development</strong> through a combination of self-study, bootcamp programs, and a whole lot of trial and error. I call myself an apprentice because I never stop learning—there's always something new to figure out, and I love every minute of it.</p>
                <p>Though I'm not a professional researcher, I have a deep interest in <strong>theoretical physics</strong> and exploring the unknown. My goal is to build programs that help uncover new findings, whether it’s through analyzing large datasets or creating tools to assist in theoretical research. Some of these ideas may be groundbreaking—at least that's what I hope for! I also enjoy working with <strong>databases</strong> and APIs, drawing inspiration from how they’re used in projects like Hubble and CERN, to process and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently.</p>
                <p>This journey has also included a focus on the broader spectrum of full-stack skills—from front-end design and JavaScript to crafting elegant, data-driven back-end solutions. It’s all about bringing different pieces of technology together to create cohesive and innovative user experiences.</p>
                <p>Here are some of my hobbies that keep my curiosity alive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I love all kinds of games, from immersive open-world RPGs to competitive team-based matches. Gaming is where I draw a lot of my inspiration for interactive design and user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electronics and Modding:</strong> I've always been fascinated by the inner workings of devices. Whether it’s <strong>soldering components</strong>, creating custom mods, or fixing broken gadgets, I love getting hands-on with hardware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> The idea of making machines think is something that keeps me excited. I'm currently working on training different <strong>AI models</strong> and trying to understand how AI can enhance our everyday lives. The potential there is endless.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When I'm not coding or tinkering, you'll find me brainstorming new ideas for projects—whether it’s an innovative AI setup or a fun game that brings people together. My goal is to use technology creatively, to solve problems, and to inspire others to do the same.</p>
